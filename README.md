# Simple Dependency Injection

Goal is to understand/show the basics of spring magic.
To learn follow the WinterApplication.run()

How to Use?:
1. Include the Jar
2. Add annotations to the Class
3. Call WinterApplication.run() in your main method


DONE:
1. Annotation based injection, @Component @Autowired(onConstructorOnly)
2. Configuration classes, bean
3. BruteFactory (not to use this)
4. @Value based injection on Boxed type
5. Profile based property reader


TODO:
1. Interface based injection
2. @Bean method to support parameter
